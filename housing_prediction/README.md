This Program analyses a data set with over 16,000 housing instances, including features such as: median income, number of rooms, proximity to ocean, etc. I used a Random Forest Regressor to predict the median house price of a Californian districts. I then used a cross-validation algorithm to asses the results and optimized the model using a Randomized Search algorithm.
